# Car_Price_Predict_Linear_Regression
This is my first project where I create a linear regression model to predict the price of car. I use data from kaggle.com

# Link to the dataset I used in the project : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction

# A better choice for data analysis will be a Jupyter file



# Application test for dataset from kaggle, for car with Car_ID = 1
